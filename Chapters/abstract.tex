The development of process algebras is of considerable interest in the study of distributed and mobile computation.  After considering the nature of distributed and mobile systems, we will look at two variants of the \picalc, a modern process algebra given by Milner, that can be used to model such systems.  We will then compare the expressive power of these calculi and explore the extent to which they can simulate one another.  Particular attention will be paid to the specific constructs wherein the calculi differ and whether and how these constructs represent behaviors found in real distributed and mobile systems.  \end{center}
