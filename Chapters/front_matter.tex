\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A Word About Formatting}
One of the pedagogical aims of this thesis is to be as clear and reader-assistive as possible during its presentation.  To that end, I have taken several liberties in the formatting of this thesis.  Figures, equations, definitions, theorems and examples all share one numbering scheme in hopes that it will make them easier to locate. Where \defmargin{definitions} appear, they are clad in italics as well as in a margin box to make them easier to find.  Equation numbers also appear in margin boxes.  When \refmargin{definitions} definitions or equations are referred to later in the text, an assistive link will appear in the margin to avoid index-fingering.  To this end, the wired reader will note the presence within the backcover of a searchable pdf version of the text, wherein all references are hyper-textual (clickable).  The included CD also contains all the code referenced in this thesis.

In this thesis I will blow your mind, and possibly (hopefully?) my own in the process.
