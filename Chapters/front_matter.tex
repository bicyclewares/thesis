\section*{A Word About The Format of This Thesis}
One of the pedagogical aims of this thesis is to be clear and reader-assistive during its presentation.  To that end, I have taken several liberties in the formatting of this thesis.  Figures, equations, definitions, theorems and examples all share one numbering scheme in hopes that it will make them easier to locate. Where important \defmargin{definitions} appear, they are clad in italics and sit in a box on the margin to make them easier to find.  When \refmargin{definitions} definitions or equations are referred to later in the text, an assistive link will appear in the margin to avoid index-fingering.  In addition, the wired reader will find a searchable pdf version of the text at the following url:
